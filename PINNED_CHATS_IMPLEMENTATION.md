# Pinned Chats Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a pinned chats feature that displays pinned chats in a new category at the top of the sidebar history.

## Changes Made

### 1. Core Type Updates
- **`lib/types/ui.ts`**: Added `isPinned: boolean` field to the `UIChat` interface
- **`lib/message-conversion.ts`**: Updated `dbChatToUIChat` function to include the `isPinned` field

### 2. Sidebar History Updates
- **`components/sidebar-history.tsx`**: 
  - Added `pinned: UIChat[]` to the `GroupedChats` type
  - Updated `groupChatsByDate` function to handle pinned chats (they're separated out first)
  - Added "Pinned" section to the render logic at the top of the chat list
  - Added proper spacing between pinned and other sections

### 3. Anonymous Chat Support
- **`lib/utils/anonymous-chat-storage.ts`**: 
  - Updated `saveAnonymousChatToStorage` to include `isPinned` field
  - Updated `cloneAnonymousChat` to set `isPinned: false` for cloned chats
- **`hooks/use-chat-store.ts`**: 
  - Fixed `useGetAllChats` to include `isPinned` field for anonymous chats
  - Fixed `useGetChatById` to include `isPinned` field for anonymous chats  
  - Fixed `useSaveChat` to include `isPinned: false` for new anonymous chats

## Database Schema
The database already had the `isPinned` boolean field in the chat table, so no database changes were needed.

## How It Works
1. When chats are loaded, they're grouped by the `groupChatsByDate` function
2. Pinned chats (where `isPinned: true`) are extracted first into a separate `pinned` array
3. The remaining chats are grouped by date as before (Today, Yesterday, etc.)
4. The sidebar renders the "Pinned" section at the top, followed by the date-based sections
5. Both authenticated and anonymous users are supported

## UI Behavior
- Pinned chats appear in a "Pinned" section at the top of the sidebar
- The "Pinned" section only appears when there are pinned chats
- There's proper spacing between the pinned section and other sections
- All existing functionality (rename, delete, etc.) works with pinned chats

The implementation is complete and ready for use. The next step would be to add UI controls to allow users to pin/unpin chats.
