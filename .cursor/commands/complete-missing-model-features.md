# Complete Model Features

For all of the models in `lib/models/missing-model-features.json`, I want you to search online and to create a key-value in `lib/models/model-features.ts`

## Rules
- Create a TODO task for each of them and then search online for each task
- If you need the names, they are in `lib/models/models.generated.ts`

## Task
- Read `lib/models/missing-model-features.json`
- Create a TODO task for each of them
- Search online for each task
- Create a key-value in `lib/models/model-features.ts`
- Run `bun test:types` to check for errors
